# ShapeClassification
A CNN to classify different types of basic shapes.

Instructions:
1) Install requirements and environment with:
"make install"
2) Run with "make classifier"

Note:
The UI allows one to train a new model, see statistics for a loaded model or evaluate a model by passing in paths to images to be classified.

The model loaded can be changed in shapeClassifier.py with saveModelName variable.
When running shapeClassifier.py directly, one can input arguments such as batchsize, epochs and learning rate.
Note: The model created is only as good as the data given to it.
